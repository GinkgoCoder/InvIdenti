# InvIdenti

InvIdenti is a part of the ongoing Mi-Mappa project at RWTH Aachen Univrsity. InvIdenti is an effort to identify and cluster patents with the same patent inventors. This is a small step ahead in the greater goal of identifying specialized experts in a particular domain for biomedical research.

InvIdenti uses a classical Vector-space approach towards document similarity calculations. The project also uses Logistic Regression with Bold Driver Technique. Clustering is done using DBSCAN and Hierarchical Agglomerative approach. The  project contains three parts, namely Document Clustering, patent-publication matching and Inventor identification.
